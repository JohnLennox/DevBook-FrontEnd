# Dude, where's my backend?

Hello all, Zark Muckerberg was all prepared for the launch of his new developer only social network - DevBook.

All was going swimmingly well until release day when it became apparent that the backend system has vanished...
Investigations are ongoing... however the launch cannot wait until then, thankfully we have a Crack team of super  
developers on standby ready to save the day.  

Instructions are provided below and if you have any questions please feel free to reach out and clarify.

Thankfully some things were salvaged so not all hope is lost, we still have the following:
* React frontend
* Security implementation classes for our back end
* Detailed explanation of our API contracts  

Without further ado lets get started...
